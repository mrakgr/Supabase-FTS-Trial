# Overview

I am doing some research on how FTS with Supabase could be made to work at the behest of the founder. Replit is working a lot smoother for me now than last year when it was impossible to get Node and Typescript going.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it is possible to setup Supabase locally due to the lack of Docker on Replit. The CLI tool tries getting the Docker image for Supabase and then aborts.

The CLI tool works, so I'll focus on using just it with a remote db.

Would it be possible to have a Supabase local install on Replit?
